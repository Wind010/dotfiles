# dotfiles
My development environment dotfiles


Included `Powershell` script named `create_symlinks_windows.ps1` to apply on Windows after evaluating [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) and [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

On Linux and MacOS use `create_symlinks.sh` to create symlinks.


These just need to be applied one time unless a new file is added in which all relevant scripts should be updated.
